# Collecting and Viewing Logs from Kubernetes using SigNoz and OpenTelemetry

A Complete Beginner-Friendly Guide

## 📘 Overview

In today's cloud-native world, monitoring logs from distributed applications running on Kubernetes has become crucial for debugging, performance tuning, and observability. However, setting up such a telemetry pipeline can be challenging for beginners — especially when using local clusters like Kind that lack native container log directories.

This guide walks you step-by-step through the process of collecting, enriching, and visualising logs using SigNoz Cloud and OpenTelemetry. Whether you're a student, developer, or observability enthusiast, this tutorial is designed to be simple, replicable, and insightful.

## 🎯 What We'll Build

We will:
- Spin up a local Kubernetes cluster with Docker + Kind
- Deploy SigNoz using Helm
- Create dummy application logs on the host machine
- Configure OpenTelemetry Collector (otelAgent) to collect and tag logs
- Visualise the logs on SigNoz Cloud using service.name filters

## 💡 Solution Architecture & Flow

1. **Set up local Kubernetes (Kind) with Docker**
2. **Deploy SigNoz core components using the Helm chart**
3. **Create dummy log files on the host system**
4. **Mount host logs into the Kubernetes pod using volume mounts**
5. **Configure OpenTelemetry Collector (otelAgent) to parse logs and add metadata**
6. **Forward logs to SigNoz Cloud endpoint for visualization**

This allows us to simulate log collection even in restricted environments like Kind, making the setup suitable for experimentation and learning.

## 🌐 Understanding Telemetry and OpenTelemetry

### 🔸 What is Telemetry?
Telemetry refers to the automatic collection of operational data from applications or infrastructure. It includes:
- **Logs**: Text-based messages capturing events
- **Metrics**: Numeric indicators such as CPU/memory usage
- **Traces**: Spans that describe the flow of a request through services

### 🔸 What is OpenTelemetry?
OpenTelemetry is an open-source framework for instrumenting, collecting, processing, and exporting telemetry data. It supports various SDKs and has a Collector component that centralizes and forwards telemetry to a backend (like SigNoz).

In this project, we use the OpenTelemetry Collector configured via Helm (k8s-infra chart).

## 🖥️ Prerequisites: Installation Instructions

### 🔹 Docker Desktop

**For macOS:**
- Visit [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- Download the .dmg file
- Drag Docker to Applications and launch it

**For Windows:**
- Visit [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- Download and install the .exe installer
- Restart system if required and launch Docker

**For Linux:**
Use Docker Engine:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io
sudo systemctl enable docker --now
```

## ✅ STEP 1: Install Prerequisite Tools

### 🔹 1.1 Install Docker Desktop (Mac)
**Purpose:** Docker is used to run containers and Kubernetes clusters via Kind.

**Steps:**
1. Download: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
2. Choose the right version for your chip (Apple Silicon or Intel)
3. Install and open Docker
4. Make sure it shows "Docker is running" (you'll see a 🐳 icon at the top bar)

**✅ After installing, run:** `docker version`

### 🔹 1.2 Install Homebrew (if not installed)
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

### 🔹 1.3 Install kubectl – Kubernetes CLI
```bash
brew install kubectl
```
**✅ Check:** `kubectl version --client`

### 🔹 1.4 Install helm – Kubernetes Package Manager
```bash
brew install helm
```
**✅ Check:** `helm version`

### 🔹 1.5 Install kind – Kubernetes in Docker
```bash
brew install kind
```
**✅ Check:** `kind version`

## ✅ STEP 2: Create a Kubernetes Cluster with Kind

### 🔹 2.1 Open Terminal and run:
```bash
kind create cluster --name signoz-cluster
```

### 🔹 2.2 ✅ Verify the cluster:
```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

**Expected output:**
```
NAME                           STATUS   ROLES           AGE   VERSION
signoz-cluster-control-plane   Ready    control-plane   1m    v1.27.3
```

## ✅ STEP 3: Add SigNoz Helm Chart Repository

### 🔹 3.1 Add repository and update:
```bash
helm repo add signoz https://charts.signoz.io
helm repo update
```

## ✅ STEP 4: Deploy SigNoz Core (Signoz chart)

### 🔹 4.1 Create a namespace:
```bash
kubectl create namespace signoz
```

### 🔹 4.2 Install SigNoz:
```bash
helm install signoz signoz/signoz -n signoz
```

### 🔹 4.3 Wait 2–3 minutes, then check pods:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n signoz
```

**Expected running pods:**
- query-service
- frontend
- alertmanager
- otel-collector
- clickhouse
- ingester
- etc.

## ✅ STEP 5: Configure k8s-infra with override-values.yaml

### 🔹 5.1 Use the provided configuration file:
Copy the `override-values.yaml` file from this repository and update the following placeholders:

- Replace `<CLUSTER_NAME>` with your cluster name (e.g., `signoz-cluster`)
- Replace `<DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT>` with your environment (e.g., `development`)
- Replace `<SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY>` with your actual SigNoz Cloud ingestion key
- Update the region in the endpoint if needed (`us`, `in`, or `eu`)

## ✅ STEP 6: Install k8s-infra Helm Chart

```bash
helm install k8s-infra signoz/k8s-infra -f override-values.yaml -n signoz
```

### ✅ Check that the log collector is running:
```bash
kubectl get daemonsets -n signoz
```

## ✅ STEP 7: Verify Logs in SigNoz Cloud

1. Go to: https://signoz.io/
2. Log in to your account
3. Click on **Logs Explorer**
4. In the filter, enter: `service.name = "query-service"`

You should see logs from your Kubernetes cluster!

## 📷 Expected Screenshots

For validation, you should be able to capture:
1. `kubectl get pods -n signoz` showing all pods running
2. SigNoz Logs Explorer showing results for `service.name = "query-service"`
3. YAML config file open in VS Code or terminal
4. Sample log output in SigNoz interface

## 📊 Task Completion Summary

| Task | Status |

## 🏁 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to monitor logs in a local Kubernetes setup using industry-standard observability tools like SigNoz and OpenTelemetry. By addressing practical challenges in collecting logs from Kind and enriching them with metadata, this guide offers a production-relevant workflow that is also accessible to newcomers.

This template can serve as a go-to reference for anyone setting up logging pipelines in Kubernetes environments.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Volume mount conflicts**: Ensure you're using the simplified `override-values.yaml` configuration without custom volume mounts
2. **Failed helm installations**: Use `helm uninstall <release-name> -n <namespace>` to clean up failed installations
3. **SigNoz Cloud connection issues**: Verify your ingestion key and region endpoint are correct

### Useful Commands:

```bash
# Check helm releases
helm list -n signoz

# Check pod logs
kubectl logs <pod-name> -n signoz

# Restart a deployment
kubectl rollout restart deployment/<deployment-name> -n signoz
```
